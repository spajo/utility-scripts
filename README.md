# Utility scripts which I wrote lol

## clipboard.py

This script strips the copied string of newlines.

## icons.py

This scripts converts css icons such as

```css
.icon-alarm-level1::before {  
    content: '\e902';
}
```

to public static fields with javadocs in java as such (it probably won't be rendered here because of missing fonts lol)

```java
/**
 * <span style="font-size: 80px;" >î¤‚</span>
 */
public static final String ALARM_LEVEL1 = "\ue902";
```
